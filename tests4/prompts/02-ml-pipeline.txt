Create a machine learning pipeline diagram showing:

Data flow: Raw Data → Preprocessing → Feature Engineering → Model Training → Evaluation → Deployment

With a feedback loop from Evaluation back to Feature Engineering (for iteration)
And a monitoring loop from Deployment back to Data collection

Use distinct colors for data stages vs model stages.
