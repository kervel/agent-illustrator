/******** VISUAL DESIGN
   Overall shape: Infinity symbol (∞) with two loops side-by-side
   Color scheme: Dev processes → steelblue, Ops processes → lightgreen, hubs → gold
   Key visual features: Two loops, curved cross-connections, clear directional flow
*/

/******** SHAPE CHOICES
   Plan, Code, Build, Test, Release, Deploy, Operate, Monitor → rect because they are process steps
   Dev hub, Ops hub → circle because they are loop anchors
*/

/******** CONNECTION TYPES
   Within each loop: orthogonal because it reads cleanly left-to-right and top-to-bottom
   Cross-loop links: curved because they form the infinity crossover
   Feedback to start: curved because it emphasizes continuous cycle
