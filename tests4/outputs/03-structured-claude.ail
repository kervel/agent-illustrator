/* SPECIFICATION
   What: Hub-and-spoke architecture with API Gateway at center and five services as spokes
   Elements: API Gateway (hub), User Service, Order Service, Payment Service, Inventory Service, Notification Service (spokes)
   Relationships: Bidirectional connections from hub to each spoke
*/

   Visual shape: Central circle surrounded by 5 rectangles in a radial pattern
   Strategy: Central hub in middle; services arranged in circular pattern around it (top, bottom, left, right, diagonal)
   Structure: group with central hub; surrounding row/col layout with services positioned radially
*/
