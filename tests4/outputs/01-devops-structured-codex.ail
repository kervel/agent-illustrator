/************************ SPECIFICATION
   What: DevOps infinity loop showing continuous cycle between Dev (Plan, Code, Build, Test) and Ops (Release, Deploy, Operate, Monitor)
   Elements: Plan, Code, Build, Test, Release, Deploy, Operate, Monitor
   Relationships: Plan -> Code -> Build -> Test -> Release -> Deploy -> Operate -> Monitor -> Plan (cycle)
*/

/************************ LAYOUT PLAN
   Visual shape: Infinity (two loops side-by-side)
   Strategy: Two 2x2 grids side-by-side; connect diagonally with direct routing to imply loop crossings
   Structure: row { col { row { Plan Code } row { Build Test } } col { row { Release Deploy } row { Operate Monitor } } }
*/
