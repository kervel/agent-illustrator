/* SPECIFICATION
   What: Hub-and-spoke architecture with API Gateway at center connected bidirectionally to five services
   Elements: API Gateway, User Service, Order Service, Payment Service, Inventory Service, Notification Service
   Relationships: API Gateway has bidirectional connections to each service
*/

/* LAYOUT PLAN
   Visual shape: Hub in center with spokes around
   Strategy: Use group with central hub and surrounding row/col to suggest radiating spokes
   Structure: group { col { row { user order payment } row { gateway } row { inventory notification } } }
*/
