/* SPECIFICATION
   What: DevOps infinity loop showing continuous cycle of development and operations
   Elements: Plan, Code, Build, Test (Dev side), Release, Deploy, Operate, Monitor (Ops side)
   Relationships: Left loop flows downward (Plan→Code→Build→Test), right loop flows downward (Release→Deploy→Operate→Monitor), with cross-connections at top and bottom to form infinity symbol
*/

/* LAYOUT PLAN
   Visual shape: Infinity symbol (∞) with two interconnected loops
   Strategy: Two vertical 2x2 grids positioned side-by-side, with Test connecting to Release and Monitor connecting to Plan to complete the figure-8
   Structure: col { row { left_loop right_loop } } where each loop is col { row { stage1 stage2 } row { stage3 stage4 } }
*/
