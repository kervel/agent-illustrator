Create a DevOps infinity loop diagram showing the continuous cycle:

Left side (Dev): Plan → Code → Build → Test
Right side (Ops): Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor

The diagram should visually convey:
- Two interconnected loops forming an infinity symbol (∞)
- Dev activities on the left, Ops activities on the right
- The continuous, cyclical nature of DevOps
- Clear flow direction between stages
