Create a flowchart for a user login process:

1. Start
2. "Enter Credentials" - user inputs username/password
3. "Validate" - check if credentials are correct
4. If valid: go to "Load Profile" then "Dashboard" (success end)
5. If invalid: go to "Show Error", then "Increment Attempts"
6. "Check Attempts" - if attempts < 3, go back to "Enter Credentials"
7. If attempts >= 3, go to "Lock Account" (failure end)

The flowchart should clearly show:
- The happy path (successful login)
- The retry loop (failed but can retry)
- The lockout path (too many failures)
