# Variation C: Question-Driven

## Layout Planning

Before coding, answer these questions:

1. **What shape should viewers see?** (not what data exists)
   - "A loop" → arrange circularly
   - "A flow" → arrange linearly
   - "An 8/infinity" → two loops connected

2. **What primitives create that shape?**
   - Circles/arcs for curves
   - Rows/cols for grids
   - Paths for custom shapes

3. **Where do items go on that shape?**
   - On the edges of circles
   - At grid intersections
   - Along path vertices

Example: "DevOps cycle" → viewers should see infinity loop → two circles → 4 items per circle, arrows follow the curve
