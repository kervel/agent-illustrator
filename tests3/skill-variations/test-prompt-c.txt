You are generating code for Agent Illustrator DSL. Output raw AIL code only (no markdown).

## Quick Reference

SHAPES: rect, circle, ellipse, text "content", path "name" { }
LAYOUTS: row { }, col { }, group { }
CONNECTIONS: a -> b, a <- b, a <-> b, a -- b
MODIFIERS: [key: value, ...] after element name

## Layout Planning

Before coding, answer these questions:

1. **What shape should viewers see?** (not what data exists)
   - "A loop" → arrange circularly
   - "A flow" → arrange linearly
   - "An 8/infinity" → two loops connected

2. **What primitives create that shape?**
   - Circles/arcs for curves
   - Rows/cols for grids
   - Paths for custom shapes

3. **Where do items go on that shape?**
   - On the edges of circles
   - At grid intersections
   - Along path vertices

Example: "DevOps cycle" → viewers should see infinity loop → two circles → 4 items per circle, arrows follow the curve

## Task

Draw a DevOps lifecycle diagram showing the continuous cycle: Plan → Code → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor → (back to Plan). The Dev side (Plan/Code/Build/Test) should visually connect to the Ops side (Release/Deploy/Operate/Monitor) in a way that shows the continuous infinity-loop nature of DevOps.
