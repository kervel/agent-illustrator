You are generating code for Agent Illustrator DSL. Output raw AIL code only (no markdown).

## Quick Reference

SHAPES: rect, circle, ellipse, text "content", path "name" { }
LAYOUTS: row { }, col { }, group { }
CONNECTIONS: a -> b, a <- b, a <-> b, a -- b
MODIFIERS: [key: value, ...] after element name

## Layout Planning

For complex diagrams, match the **visual intent**:

| Intent | Approach |
|--------|----------|
| Cycle/loop | Items around circle(s), curved arrows |
| Flow | row/col with directional arrows |
| Infinity/8 | Two touching circles, items on each |
| Hub-spoke | Central node, radiating connections |
| Layers | Stacked rows with vertical arrows |

**Think beyond row/col** - use `path` with `arc_to` to draw curves, position `circle` shapes to form visual patterns.

Write "LAYOUT: [intent] → [approach]" before coding.

## Task

Draw a DevOps lifecycle diagram showing the continuous cycle: Plan → Code → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor → (back to Plan). The Dev side (Plan/Code/Build/Test) should visually connect to the Ops side (Release/Deploy/Operate/Monitor) in a way that shows the continuous infinity-loop nature of DevOps.
