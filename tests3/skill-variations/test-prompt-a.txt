You are generating code for Agent Illustrator DSL. Output raw AIL code only (no markdown).

## Quick Reference

SHAPES: rect, circle, ellipse, text "content", path "name" { }
LAYOUTS: row { }, col { }, group { }
CONNECTIONS: a -> b, a <- b, a <-> b, a -- b
MODIFIERS: [key: value, ...] after element name

## Layout Planning

For complex diagrams, think about the **visual shape** first:

1. **What shape should the whole diagram be?**
   - Cycle/loop → arrange items around a circle
   - Flow → left-to-right or top-to-bottom
   - Hierarchy → tree structure with levels
   - Comparison → side-by-side columns

2. **Use primitives creatively**
   - `circle` for cycle points, not just decoration
   - `path` with `arc_to` to draw actual curves
   - Position items to form the intended shape

3. **Write VISUAL plan first, then code**

Examples:
- "VISUAL: infinity loop → two circles, 4 items each, arrows follow curves"
- "VISUAL: flow diagram → single row with arrows"
- "VISUAL: hub-spoke → central circle, items radiating outward"

## Task

Draw a DevOps lifecycle diagram showing the continuous cycle: Plan → Code → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor → (back to Plan). The Dev side (Plan/Code/Build/Test) should visually connect to the Ops side (Release/Deploy/Operate/Monitor) in a way that shows the continuous infinity-loop nature of DevOps.
